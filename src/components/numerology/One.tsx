      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 1 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Creativity, discipline, independence, leadership…</em>
      <p>
        Creativity, discipline, independence, leadership… These are traits
        associated with destiny number 1. With expression number/destiny number
        1, you are a born leader. Willpower, strength and determination help you
        achieve leadership positions, gaining success while reaching goals. With
        destiny number 1, you are the master of your destiny and life path. You
        will not tolerate people telling you what to do. You dictate to them
        while being the centre of attention. Your creativity will help you stay
        on top and you all keep finding new ways to reach goals. Whether they
        are goals in family, or career — you will excel in any career where you
        can lead, as number 1. But you need to be careful. You are strong willed
        as a 1, which may make you seem blunt, selfish and a number of other
        negatives.
      </p>
      <em>The Need for Power</em>
      <p>
        As expression number 1, you will not be happy when you are not in power.
        Because of this, destiny number 1 people tend to be entrepreneurs, CEOs,
        principals, executives and politicians. These high-power careers will
        fulfill your desire for power. Because you are independent as a 1, you
        might expect those around you to be too. This may result in situations
        where you lack patience with those who can not match you. Destiny number
        1 people need to be careful not to let your bossy side out with people.
        A strong energy of power is your nature, but your leadership may put a
        number of people in uncomfortable situations if you do not respect them.
        This applies in business and personal relationships with destiny number
        1. Your desire for power may give you an air of superiority in business
        and even in marriage, so you will miss opportunities to better yourself.
        For example, say your romantic partner has a business venture that could
        tie in with your established career. Your potentially egocentric need to
        be in charge of it could damage your partners view of you, and the
        fruits of their labor in business. Maybe you are just used to
        self-reliance, so you have not had time for growth away from it. You
        will need to be patient with others, listen to them and know you dont
        need to lead constantly. To see where you could excel in a leadership
        position also consider your soul urge and expression numbers. These
        other numbers in your numerology chart come together to create your

      <em>Picking a Career</em>
      <p>
        It is already been said that destiny number 1 fits well in a number of
        roles. It may be difficult to pick one path. Do you go for a career
        where you have decent power, but help others? Or do you want to lead
        large groups and influence the masses? You need to look at yourself as a
        1 and see what works for your life, then follow that road. If your prone
        to give into your ego, maybe you need to take a step back from your
        power-lust. Becoming a teacher or principal may work. You will get to
        lead people without the means to go too far. As a principal, staff and
        students look to you to run the school. As a teacher, you get to be the
        center of the students attention and flex your creativity. Unfortunately
        for those with the destiny number 1, you dont always let your creative
        side show. Educating children takes some real originality to spread your
        ideas and wisdom believably to young minds. Those are ways you could go
        if you dont want action or drama, but want that 1 authority. But if
        money, opportunity for growth and showing off your abilities is your
        mission, you may want to aim higher. So long as you know you will not be
        blunt or harsh with people. Here is where you could start a business and
        build an empire. Gain the trust and admiration of employees, customers,
        and business partners, and see your efforts applauded on a greater
        scale. You have the tools to make a change in the world. Give yourself
        the permission to do it, number 1. Just dont let your powerful work be
        more important than love or family. You could be a great, dominant asset
        in a family, if you keep your 1 ego under control. You will also find
        that your career choices are heavily influenced by your soul urge number
        and personality numbers. To see how these numbers all work together to

        potential.

      <em>Staying Independent</em>
      <p>
        People in power have the luxury of being independent, which is a natural
        1 trait you have. But once you have established a leadership in work, in
        family, in your lifestyle, it is easy to let that slip away. You might
        have employees who want to be promoted up to a partnership. You might
        find a spouse who is as dominant as you are, and clash in your views.
        You need to associate with people who suit your domineering 1
        personality. In staff, you should look for submissive but intuitive
        people who work to your 1 standards but are dependant upon you for your
        lead. They will not try to take your independent leadership from you. In
        a romantic partner, find someone who is okay with taking a backseat in
        the relationship. Someone who is okay with you planning all the family
        activities, being the sole breadwinner, with you not confiding hardships
        in them so you can solve problems alone. But know that it is okay to ask
        for help when you need it, and know to take others opinions into
        consideration. Being selfish will not help you stay independent. Take
        breaks if your family recommends it. Let your partner take you out on
        dates, giving them the power. Really, you need to find a balance in
        staying independent and knowing what scenarios you can give it up in.

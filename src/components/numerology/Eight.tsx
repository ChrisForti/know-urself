      <h2>A Career in Authority</h2>
      <em>You have authority over so much, destiny number 8.</em>
      <p>
        You are a leader number 8. This alone, makes careers hard for you, as
        you need to be on top. You need to be in power, or it probably will not
        work out. Eights tend to be entrepreneurs and risk-takers in their
        careers. Forgoing that, you’re suited to a career in military,
        government, finance or banking—so long as you can work your way to the
        top. You’re powerful and need a career that’ll reward you for your hard
        work. People with destiny number 8 excel beyond any other destiny
        number. Your pursuit of power drives you past the boundaries. Your
        mission is to get through obstacles that stand in your way to the top,
        and stay there. That’s why, in most cases, you won’t be suited to a
        career that doesn’t put you in a leadership position. Your intolerance
        is clear. Even if you can’t get a job with true power, eights make
        excellent managers. As a destiny number eight, you have the organization
        and leadership qualities for it. Under a circumstance where you do find
        comfort in a power-free job, you’re the perfect employee, destiny number
        8. You’re a great motivator of your peers and a hand-working mastermind.
        You’ll probably climb your way to the top, intentional or not. But you
        need to be very careful with your ambitions here. It can put a strain on
        your relationship as you neglect family to focus on work. Since failures
        aren’t your forté, you should aim for a balance. Focus on what matters,
        the loved ones who fill your heart and soul, and don’t let work
        influence you to turn away from them.
      </p>
      <h2>Determination to Succeed</h2>
      <p>
        Individuality is a gift, destiny number 8. And being the type of
        individual you are, a hard-working one focused on the liberation of
        yourself, can be a challenge. Why do people want to be on top? For
        attention? To do good and reap a reward? Or is it for freedom? The
        freedom that respected leaders have to be themselves. It’s one of the
        benefits of being on top. It’s most likely your darker traits that push
        you to be independent. You’re distrustful of others. Paranoid that
        everyone’s out to get you. Suspicious of the competition. You need to be
        free and operate alone. Being successful at work will help you better
        yourself, destiny number 8. Once you’re on top of your game, there’s no
        need to be suspicious that anyone’s trying to beat you to it. Just be
        careful not to let your conservative beliefs and unemotional nature get
        in the way once you hit the top. Your determination to succeed may also
        help with your tendency to neglect relationships, number 8. Once you
        succeed in business, you’re out of the race. Giving you plenty of time
        to mend broken relationships and start new ones. If you’re struggling
        with love relationships, people, life and family, just hold on to the
        need to succeed. You can succeed in more than just work, you know. Being
        successful in a career brings money. Being successful in relationships
        brings another kind of wealth to your soul, number 8.
      </p>
      <h2>Distrust</h2>
      <p>
        Sadly number 8, it’s not just work that can take a hit because of your
        distrust. You’re just a suspicious and skeptical person overall. You
        need to be careful with this in every aspect of your life, as an 8. Say
        you’ve achieved your greatest career goal, you’re married and you have a
        family. Now what, number 8? You’re successful in everything in life.
        What’s left to strive for? Without something to work towards, your
        distrustful side as an 8 may take over. You could get paranoid and start
        thinking it’s all too good to be true. That your company will fail. That
        your spouse will leave you. Remember that you’ve had a lot of luck and
        good fortune to get where you are. But on top of that, you’ve worked for
        it. You’ve walked the right paths, utilized honesty, developed wisdom
        and a better character within yourself. Even if anyone were trying to
        take away your work or your family, you wouldn’t let them. You are the
        master of your purpose. Don’t let your distrust of people take away your
        successes, destiny number 8.

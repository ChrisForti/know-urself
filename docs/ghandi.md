"Carefully watch your thoughts, for they become your words. Manage and watch your words, for they will become your actions. Consider and judge 
your actions, for they have become your habits. Acknowledge and watch your habits, for they shall become your values. Understand and embrace 
your values, for they become your destiny." ~ Mahatma Gandhi

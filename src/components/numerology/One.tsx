      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 1 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Creativity, discipline, independence, leadership…</em>
      <p>
        Creativity, discipline, independence, leadership… These are traits
        associated with destiny number 1. With expression number/destiny number
        1, you are a born leader. Willpower, strength and determination help you
        achieve leadership positions, gaining success while reaching goals. With
        destiny number 1, you are the master of your destiny and life path. You
        will not tolerate people telling you what to do. You dictate to them
        while being the centre of attention. Your creativity will help you stay
        on top and you all keep finding new ways to reach goals. Whether they
        are goals in family, or career — you will excel in any career where you
        can lead, as number 1. But you need to be careful. You are strong willed
        as a 1, which may make you seem blunt, selfish and a number of other
        negatives.

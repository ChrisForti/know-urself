      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 3 Mean for?</h1>
      <em>Optimistic, entertaining, humorous, romantis, creative.</em>
      <p>
        Being a number 3, makes you a true artist and entertainer. Expressing
        your truth in creative, joyful and uplifting ways. If you are destiny
        number 3, your optimism makes you a joy to be near. Your so easy to be
        around. You hide disappointment behind wit, humour, and a perky
        expression. You will never let anyone see you in pain. You crave the
        love of family and friends but you refuse to let anyone know. Luckily
        people love you. You are a performer and full of creativity as a 3.
      </p>
      <h2>Picking a Career</h2>
      <p>
        It goes without saying that 3 Expression Numbers perform best when they
        have an audience to entertain. But this does not necessarily mean they
        need to be “performers”. Working in marketing and sales could be a great
        fit, as could any position where communication (both written or spoken)
        is required. The creative industries can be ideal places for those with
        this Expression Number to thrive: Theatre, film or music, and even
        journalism could be ideal, depending on the rest of the Numerology
        chart.
      </p>
      <h2>3's downside</h2>
      <p>
        When not expressing at their highest, the Destiny Number 3 can be fake,
        and people-pleasing. Their need for recognition means that these
        creative people may actually lose touch with their own inner truth,
        instead “performing” for the crowd. Yet inauthentic creativity can be a
        death-knell for this Destiny Number. The breadth of creative talents
        that the Destiny Number 3 can turn their hand to means that they may
        struggle with sticking power. Flitting from talent to talent, yet never
        fully developing a single one, means they may fail to really succeed in
        life. For this reason, developing discipline early on in life will
        really serve them.

      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 2 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Diplomatic, cooperative, tactful, persuasive, good listener…</em>

        have a downside. You can be a tad overprotective with people you love.

        stifling, even patronizing. Being patronizing is part of being a
        mediator, unfortunately, destiny number 2. It is something you can work

        great diplomat. But your positive attributes also scream suitability for

        you away. If thats not for you either, then consider jobs where you are
        the peacemaker. Teachers make peace among students at school. A
        psychologist, advisor or someone in psychiatry makes people at peace
        with themselves. It is a big responsibility, but you have the wisdom for
        it as a 2.

        understanding as yourself. The unfortunate truth is your overprotective
        tendency as a 2 is not a quality to be proud of. You love your family,
        your partner, your career. But in order to have a healthy partnership,
        give your kids a happy childhood, you will need to reign in those
        protective energies. It is understandable that your like this as a 2. A
        loving, caring individual is bound to express this to their loved ones
        in a number of ways, including this one. But you have to make sure you
        are not going too far or there will be dire consequences. Your positive
        qualities will help you take action, even if it is a challenge. Then you
        can lessen the impact of your love on your loved ones. The world is full
        of darkness and it is understandable to be fearful, especially because
        as a destiny number 2 you are a problem solver. But you need to use your
        listening skills to keep things light. Changes are hard to make, but you
        have the strength to do it destiny number 2. And understand that your
        loved ones have the strength too. As much as they love your nurturing,
        they need time to look after themselves, too. Finally, there is more to

        the energies in the weeks, months and years ahead.

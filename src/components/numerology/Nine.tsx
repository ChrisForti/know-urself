      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 9 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Artistic, generous, idealistic, poetic, visionary…</em>
      <p>
        As a visionary, you want to beautify everything. The world. Others.
        Maybe yourself. You want to achieve a lot in this lifetime through
        beauty, art and a variety of activities you can indulge in. Your main
        flaw is that you are unrealistic about doing it, number 9. You are
        impatient and want everything now. This is unrealistic and thinking this
        way can only hurt you. You are easily disappointed and sensitive. And
        you don’t do well for long periods without variety or quality. You
        refuse to wait for things to happen, and you refuse to wait for other
        people to catch up to you. If they are dull, slow or less intelligent,
        you disregard them. They are simply in the way, number 9. You can learn
        to be tolerant, destiny number 9. You would do well to learn to wait for
        people and forgive the ignorant.
        <p>
          But there are some dark words, too, destiny number 9. Depressive.
          Gullible. Impatient. Easily disappointed. Destiny number 9 people are
          fascinating. Destiny number 9 people are philanthropists. Charitable.
          Appreciators of the artistic and the beautiful. Perhaps you can
          appreciate beauty and art so much, because your overly sensitive—a
          challenging attribute that can aid your abilities as a visionary,
        </p>
        <p>
          To see how you can balance your weaknesses, look at the strengths,
          talents and gifts elsewhere in your numerology chart. You have 5 core
          numerology numbers which combine and blend together to create your
          unique soul blueprint. To learn what these numbers are, and discover
          how they blend together.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>Selfishness</h2>
      <p>
        <p>
          You have selflessness that most people lack. Selective humanity that
          knows your lifestyle is not universal. You respect those with less and
          treat them with kindness. You care for them when it’s within your
          means, number 9. Parts of your personality are beautiful. Kindness is
          one of your better characteristics and selflessness. Even when they
          don’t have much, nines take chances and give what little they have to
          those with bigger hardships. Material possessions aren’t that
          important to you and others need the gifts, number 9. Yet you have a
          side of you that deems many people aren’t worthy of your time.
        </p>
        You will only spend energy on those you think are up to your standards,
        number 9. That’s one of the challenges you’ll face in life and it might
        put you in a difficult position or two. Take note of the opportunities
        you give to those in need. The strength you offer. You don’t seek fame
        or worship from helping. You get no benefit. You’re kind and selfless.
        So why is it that in other areas of life you’re selfish, and deem almost
        nothing as worth your time?
      </p>
      <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
      <p>
        Answering the question of your paradoxical selfless/selfish personality
        is something only you can do. I only offer theories. Perhaps your
        beautiful presence, the side of you that helps those without fortune,
        comes from your sensitivity. You want to beautify everything, so you’re
        sensitive to seeing beauty in everyone as a 9. You have the power to let
        people see it within themselves. You’re a visionary and want to create
        the world that you see in your mind’s eye. So you take action and help
        those you think can help you achieve aspects of it, number 9. As a
        sensitive person, you can be overly sensitive in your pursuit of
        perfection. This can not only hurt you, but others. Proceed with
        caution, 9. You need to take responsibility for any times when you react
        in an overly-sensitive manner. If you don’t step up and act with
        honesty, it could cause a problem. Instead of taking everything to heart
        and falling into a depressive episode, focus on the better parts of the
        word. Sensitivity. Think of the feeling you get when you help someone.
        Your intuition about a group who could bring beauty to the world. Then
        do your best to control your temper, think about your goal of beauty,
        and proceed. Be aware, your sensitivity can also make you impressionable
        and gullible. As a 9 who’s easily disappointed, these things could bring
        up emotions that aren’t healthy to have.
      </p>
      <h2>Impatience</h2>
      <p>
        Although you wish to beautify the world, you may have other goals too.
        And you’re idealistic about them, sometimes to an extent that’s
        unrealistic and impractical. Your goals may even extend past wanting to
        beautify the world, but instead wanting the world itself. Your
        selfishness can creep out and override your past generosity, number 9.
        You want what you want now and if you don’t get it you’ll fall into a
        mental state that’s undesirable. This impatience may even apply to your
        selfless actions, too. You want those receiving your generosity to get
        what they need at once. You need to learn to wait for things, and even
        people. Your impatience extends to people, too. Around the ones you
        don’t feel are worthy of your time. You’re tolerant to an extent, but
        need to learn to apply it to situations where you’re being arrogant
        around people you see as lesser, number 9.

      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 9 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Artistic, generous, idealistic, poetic, visionary…</em>
      <p>
        As a visionary, you want to beautify everything. The world. Others.
        Maybe yourself. You want to achieve a lot in this lifetime through
        beauty, art and a variety of activities you can indulge in. Your main
        flaw is that you are unrealistic about doing it, number 9. You are
        impatient and want everything now. This is unrealistic and thinking this
        way can only hurt you. You are easily disappointed and sensitive. And
        you don’t do well for long periods without variety or quality. You
        refuse to wait for things to happen, and you refuse to wait for other
        people to catch up to you. If they are dull, slow or less intelligent,
        you disregard them. They are simply in the way, number 9. You can learn
        to be tolerant, destiny number 9. You would do well to learn to wait for
        people and forgive the ignorant.
        <p>
          But there are some dark words, too, destiny number 9. Depressive.
          Gullible. Impatient. Easily disappointed. Destiny number 9 people are
          fascinating. Destiny number 9 people are philanthropists. Charitable.
          Appreciators of the artistic and the beautiful. Perhaps you can
          appreciate beauty and art so much, because your overly sensitive—a
          challenging attribute that can aid your abilities as a visionary,
        </p>
        <p>
          To see how you can balance your weaknesses, look at the strengths,
          talents and gifts elsewhere in your numerology chart. You have 5 core
          numerology numbers which combine and blend together to create your
          unique soul blueprint. To learn what these numbers are, and discover
          how they blend together.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h2>Selfishness</h2>
      <span>
        <p>
          You have selflessness that most people lack. Selective humanity that
          knows your lifestyle is not universal. You respect those with less and
          treat them with kindness. You care for them when it is within your
          means, number 9. Parts of your personality are beautiful. Kindness is
          one of your better characteristics and selflessness. Even when they do
          not have much, nines take chances and give what little they have to
          those with bigger hardships. Material possessions are not that
          important to you and others need the gifts, number 9. Yet you have a
          side of you that deems many people are not worthy of your time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will only spend energy on those you think are up to your
          standards, number 9. That is one of the challenges you will face in
          life, and it might put you in a difficult position or two. Take note
          of the opportunities you give to those in need. The strength you
          offer, is you do not seek fame or worship from helping. You get no
          benefit, and your kind and selfless. So why is it that in other areas
          of life you are selfish, and deem almost nothing as worth your time?
        </p>
      </span>
      <h2>Sensitivity</h2>
      <em>
        Answering the question of your paradoxical selfless/selfish personality
        is something only you can do.
      </em>
      <span>
        <p>
          I only offer theories. Perhaps your beautiful presence, the side of
          you that helps those without fortune, comes from your sensitivity. You
          want to beautify everything, so you are sensitive to seeing beauty in
          everyone as a 9. You have the power to let people see it within
          themselves. Your a visionary and want to create the world that you see
          in your minds eye. So you take action and help those you think can
          help you achieve aspects of it, number 9. As a sensitive person, you
          can be overly sensitive in your pursuit of perfection. This can not
          only hurt you, but others.
        </p>
        <em>Proceed with caution, 9.</em>
        <p>
          You need to take responsibility for any times when you react in an
          overly-sensitive manner. If you do not step up and act with honesty,
          it could cause a problem. Instead of taking everything to heart and
          falling into a depressive episode, focus on the better parts of the
          word. Sensitivity. Think of the feeling you get when you help someone.
          Your intuition about a group who could bring beauty to the world. Then
          do your best to control your temper, think about your goal of beauty,
          and proceed. Be aware, your sensitivity can also make you
          impressionable and gullible. As a 9 who is easily disappointed, these
          things could bring up emotions that are not healthy to have.
        </p>
      </span>
      <h2>Impatience</h2>
      <span>
        <p>
          Although you wish to beautify the world, you may have other goals too.
          And you are idealistic about them, sometimes to an extent that is
          unrealistic and impractical. Your goals may even extend past wanting
          to beautify the world, but instead wanting the world itself. Your
          selfishness can creep out and override your past generosity, number 9.
          You want what you want now and if you do not get it, you will fall
          into a mental state that is undesirable. This impatience may even
          apply to your selfless actions, too. You want those receiving your
          generosity to get what they need at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to learn to wait for things, and even people. Your impatience
          extends to people, too. Around the ones you don not feel are worthy of
          your time. You are tolerant to an extent, but need to learn to apply
          it to situations where your being arrogant around people you see as
          lesser, number 9.

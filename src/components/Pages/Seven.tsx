      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 7 Mean?</h1>
      <em>
        Emotionally expressive, logical, courageous, honest, original thinker,
        investigative, wise…
      </em>
      <p>
        There are so many words to sum you up, destiny number 7. These are the
        positive ones. The ones that show you’re smart, strong and thrive on
        facts. These qualities combined make you an educator by nature, even
        when you’re not trying to be. However, your negative traits tend to get
        in the way of that. You may be intolerant of differing opinions.
        Arrogant, because clearly your original thoughts, backed up by logic
        you’ve investigated, are right. That’s not the way to share your wisdom,
        destiny number 7. You need to learn to be more open and not get detached
        and become indifferent when something doesn’t go your way. If you’re
        suspicious of something, which you tend to be, express this to people.
        Use your emotions, which are easily expressed by nature. Opening
        yourself up, accepting differing opinions and not being so big-headed,
        can only help you. Nobody’s going to listen to an educator who’s an
        arrogant cynic. You need to see the better side of people. You could
        open yourself up through studying. You love that. Facts are your best
        friends. But even that poses an issue—inside, you’re torn, because you
        have a mystic side. You’re interested in the occult, or maybe you’ve got
        a natural psychic ability on some level. But you’re suspicious of them,
        and none of it is logical. It clashes with your beliefs. Perhaps you
        could channel your conflict into music. You’ve got a natural talent for
        singing, or playing an instrument. No matter what you decide to do,
        you’ll leave a positive effect on whoever you meet. Whether it’s with
        your logic, your mystic side or your music, destiny number 7. You may
        find that your mystic side is brought down to earth by other numbers in
        your numerology chart. For instance you might have a 6 as your soul urge
        number, which would focus your attention on nurturing others through
        spirituality and mysticism. To see how your chart influences your life,

      <h2>Your Intellect</h2>
      <p>
        Sevens are intellectuals. People with the destiny number 7 love to
        educate, learn and look at life from a new perspective. You make a
        connection with people through your wisdom and your studies. Every day
        is a new lesson to learn. Sometimes you’re arrogant, but that comes with
        being intelligent. I think anyone with some intellect can get protective
        over their logical ways. Original thinkers stand by their ideas and
        thrive on facts. You’re unlikely to change your opinion so you get
        big-headed about it. Thinking is one of your strengths, after all. Your
        intellect is one of your better traits, but watch out for your dark side
        destiny number 7. Too much arrogance may eliminate friendships and put
        you into isolation. Knowing an abundance of logical facts is hard to
        deal with sometimes. But you’re just naturally talented. At studying, at
        logic, even in music. You need to be very careful not to let it go to
        your head. You’re wise enough not to let it get to you, surely, destiny
        number 7.
      </p>
      <h2>Your Claivoyance</h2>
      <p>
        You thrive on logic. Things need to make sense. Facts are facts. And the
        occult, the mysterious, psychics—not everyone believes it’s fact. But
        there’s beauty in not knowing, and you have a natural ability when it
        comes to psychic abilities. Your destiny involves helping people with
        your wisdom. Being a leader, a teacher, a charity worker who helps the
        sick, the disabled. And if you work on your psychic abilities, you could
        use those to help too. But remember how you thrive on facts, destiny
        number 7? It can be easy to want to comfort people by making up things
        you haven’t heard. Be careful to only use your psychic abilities if you
        truly believe in yourself. It wouldn’t be logical to mislead those
        you’re destined to help. You’re an honest person, destiny number 7.
        Everyone with the destiny number 7 is. Remember that when dealing in the
        occult, there are risky parts of reality that many don’t believe in as
        wholly as you do.

      <h2>Your Wisdom</h2>
      <p>
        You’re a wise person, destiny number 7. Not just through your studies
        and facts, but you’re generally wise and intelligent. You have life
        experience. Enough to grant you common sense. But your weaknesses may
        lie in the conflict between your first two traits: your intellect and
        your clairvoyance. It’s a challenge for them to co-exist in your head.
        Aspects of one are so debated, and you’re a suspicious person as a 7.
        But you know your experience, and you wouldn’t lie. Your tendency to
        doubt yourself based on your own self-imposed values is understandable.
        But it’s okay to be in the dark. So don’t let yourself fall into
        depression, or run from what you know. You’re wise enough to embrace
        your spirituality and strengthen your relationship with it, destiny
        number 7. Don’t let your skepticism get in the way. Give yourself
        permission to go into the unknown. The universe is a strange place and
        it gifted you with abilities for a reason. Maybe using them to help
        others is your fate, destiny number 7.

      <h1>Destiny Number 4 Meaning</h1>
      <p>
        Destiny number 4 people have fantastic traits. Unfortunately, destiny
        number 4 people have some strong negatives, too. Your dark side comes at
        the expense of your better qualities. While you work hard, you are rigid
        and dull when it comes to fun as a 4, You are dedicated and reliable in
        your work, but you can find it challenging to inject a sense of fun and
        play into your tasks. Someone with the expression number 4 is too
        practical to make everything fun and games. And that suits you just
        fine. Your time is valuable and you only fill it with things that
        benefit you.

      <em>Relationship goals as a 4</em>
      <p>
        Because of this, you may enjoy your own company more than being in a
        relationship. This isn not something you are sad about, because you
        prefer to be alone. Other aspects of your life as a 4 are more
        important, like work and hobbies. It is more practical to be alone, and
        far more reliable that way. Plus, it is hard to find someone with all
        the traits you value in others. Honesty, reliability, efficiency....
        Number 4's, If you do shack up, it will probably be with another number
        4. You need someone who will not sit around and gossip, and wasting
        time.

      <em>Career goals as a 4</em>
      <p>
        You will be unwaveringly loyal if you decide to partner up. You will
        also be loyal to your co-workers, or staff. You would be an asset to any
        company as you improve every system you see. You make lists until
        everything seems right, and then you fix what is broken. You delegate
        well and know what work to take onâ€”you would make an excellent manager.
        Others may see your life as dull and unfulfilled number 4, but you know
        better. You know what you value.

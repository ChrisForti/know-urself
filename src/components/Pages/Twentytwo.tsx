        People with this Master number hold the blessings of three numbers— 2,
        4, and 11. As much as numbers 2 and 4 possess their individual
        personality, they add a strong vision to number 11 too. However, on the
        other hand, these people are immensely aggressive and hard to deal with.

        keeping small aims regarding life. Master number 22 people possess sheer
        luck. But on the other hand, they are idealists and barely listen to
        others when they decide on something.

      <h1>What Does Destiny Number 5 Mean?</h1>
      <em>Carefree, adventurous, witty, progressive, enthusiastic…</em>
      <p>
        Destiny number 5 is all about communication. You are an incredible
        communicator, talking with old people and new people in different ways.
        You need a variety of people in your life to be happy. You can use your
        knack for communication to make new friends as you go through life. You
        will be making new friends a lot, as you tend to outgrow your old ones
        most of the time. Its because you are so restless as a destiny number 5.
        You need to travel, explore new places and new cultures. You have no
        time for people holding you back. You adore change and newness, number
        5. You thrive on it.
        <em>Number 5 downsides</em>
        <p>
          You get bored too quickly and this keeps you occupied. Your attention
          span is too low to stay in one place. This sounds like a downer, but
          is it really? It makes you progressive, adaptive and adventurous. You
          can have fun anywhere and handle whatever life throws at you. But try
          not to be too critical of whatever comes your way. That is something
          you need to work on as a number 5. Also, try to work on your need for
          escapism—you should be doing things for enjoyment, not to run away.
          Instead of running away from life number 5, maybe you could start a
          changeable career. Its something that could keep your short attention
          span under control, keep you busy, but keep you anchored. There is no
          room for escapism now. To find a career that is truly aligned with
          your highest good look at every

      <h2>Adventure as a 5</h2>
      <em>your an adventurer, an explorer, right to the core.</em>
      <p>
        Everyone is born with some adventure in them, but you more than any
        other, destiny number 5. Routine? Never. Business? Only if it’s daring
        and changeable. Aim for constant progress, constant change in the
        universe, to thrive, number 5. Fives have the confidence to take to the
        road with enthusiasm, hunting for new information. New people. You
        travel, not hunting wealth or intellect or to reach any goal. You just
        want a change of environment. New conditions. New times and
        eccentricity. As a 5,
      </p>
      <em>Changeable, Adventurous Worker</em>
      <p>
        But how does one survive in this wealth-driven, job-driven world, off of
        just travelling? There’s a certain romance about never staying in one
        place, living life to the fullest. But eventually, the world catches up,
        and you need to survive unless you’re already wealthy. So, to keep the
        adventure alive in a career environment, you need constant change. Your
        attention span is so short. Fives make wonderful writers and
        journalists, as there’s always a new story to tell. A 5 can make an
        incredible artist, always up for a new medium, a new piece. A new trip
        to take, to paint a new landscape or a new group of people. Or you can
        take a more stable route. Those with the destiny number 5 make excellent
        teachers. There’s always new intelligence to share, new wit to spread
        among the class. And a new class every year to keep the change you so
        desire. But if you really want a career adventure, you could even go
        into politics. The world needs a progressive leader, and your natural
        wit will help you succeed. The pursuit of a career in politics is enough
        adventure for a lifetime.
      </p>
      <em>Addiction</em>
      <p>
        The destiny number 5 brings stress with it, though. Your constant need
        to go in a new direction can have an impact on you that’s not always a
        good one. And a 5 has a naturally addictive personality. Perhaps your
        addiction is to power. Or exploration. Or escapism and running away.
        There are many aspects of life where addiction plays its wicked games.
        So you need to be careful. Surround yourself with people who match your
        character, but don’t enable your flaws. People you can share your
        feelings with, who suit your lifestyle. Your changeable nature as a 5
        means you’ll need people who change enough to stay interesting to you.
        The right people around you can make possible future-addictions into
        things that comfort you, but no more. So you’ll enjoy the power, but
        know when to take a step back. You won’t crave it, only enjoy it. You
        want things to spark excitement; you want your responsibilities to spark
        joy. But you don’t want to become addicted to what they bring, because
        what if it all comes crashing down? You can no longer travel. You’re
        forced to retire. Or worse, you fail in your career before it starts.
        Don’t let yourself get hooked on fickle things, because they’ll destroy
        you. Don’t let yourself get addicted to anything to ease the stresses of
        life, either! Everything in life has the potential to become a problem.
        Even the adventure you crave so much. Have your loved ones and family
        members ready to steady you. Others will be your salvation, even if it’s
        in your nature to leave them behind. Change the way you see the world,
        and your addictive personality will quieten. Instead, you’ll become
        addicted to the people in your life, not the thrills that can hurt you.

        A 6 numerology number is great. Be it a path number or destiny number. A
        destiny number 6 is a nurturing person. Weak and ailing people benefit
        from your existence, as they need someone to nurse them and you are the
        one to do it. They can be weak of body or of mind, and you will be their
        salvation. This makes you an asset in any relationship or friend group.
        If anyone is hurting, you can make them better. It is good that you keep
        your friends nurtured and loved because you expect a lot from them. You
        and your perfectionist nature expect a lot from yourself and others. It
        is only because you want the best in life. Others might not meet these
        expectations, but you do. You do well in whatever you set your mind to,
        whether at work or personally. Your loyal, responsible nature as a 6
        makes it easy for you to reach your goals. You would make an excellent
        employee and an even better boss. A nurturing boss is something that can
        benefit an entire company. With the help of a loyal workforce, you can
        beautify the world, destiny number 6. You idealize love and beauty and
        want to spread it to people, places and beyond.

      <h2>Perfectionism</h2>
      <p>
        Nurturing is nicely implemented into hobbies, as well as charity work
        and volunteering. Yet your perfectionism opens up other career doors for
        you, destiny number 6. Fashion and interior design come with several
        enormous responsibilities, but you need to be a perfectionist to get it
        right. Only you can pair the perfect blinds with the couch, number 6.
        Perfectionism is a skill that can help with any task. It may also be
        your downfall as a 6. You need to form some adaptability because as you
        are, you’re prone to angry outbursts if things don’t go your way, number
        6. You’re easily discouraged, fearful, anxious and insecure. Perhaps
        that’s what drives you to be so perfect. You need to be easier on
        yourself and the people around you. Not everyone will be up to your
        standards, including yourself. That’s okay, destiny number 6. You know
        that nurturing nature you have? Let it out. Spend some time on
        self-love. Beautify everything, destiny number 6. Let this beautifying
        be messy and imperfect. Yes, perfectionism will help you in life. But if
        you release the constant desire, the constant need to be perfect, your
        life will improve. You can be the best, employ the best people, employ
        the best family, without being obsessive, number 6. You can be perfect
        without manipulating others into being that way too. You’re a
        considerate, sensitive person aren’t you? You’d do well to remember
        that. Show yourself the affection you want to see others showing in the
        world.

      <h2>Romance</h2>
      <p>
        Your positive trait of nurturing and negative trait of perfectionism as
        a 6 can clash when it comes to romance. Romance doesn’t just mean a
        partner you love. Romance is a feeling of mystery and excitement,
        remoteness from everyday life. Of course, there’s romance in a
        relationship, in marriage, in family. But there’s also romance in food,
        new knowledge, jewelry, activities, even development as a person. But
        you need to be very careful and know where to seek strength. Because of
        your tendency to beat yourself up about things as a 6, you can become
        crestfallen very easily. You’re successful by nature. It’s because
        you’re responsible. You’re loyal to those you love, those you employ. At
        home and at work. And because of your empathetic and domestic nature,
        there’s something rather romantic about all of it. But the romance can
        easily be shattered by your dark side. The 6 perfectionism coming back
        to bite you. Your anxiety about whether you’re doing things right, or
        whether you’re nurturing too much. You need to know that there’s a
        balance in every part of life. So as you look at everything with this
        blissful mental romance, know that you can never truly be perfect. That
        your anxieties are misplaced. And revel in the romantic nature of life,
        art, music, environment, children and community. Once again, destiny
        number 6, your number is associated with The Lovers. So don’t let your
        nurturing or perfectionist traits take over your romantic one. Sometimes
        things don’t need to be nurtured, and life isn’t perfect.

      <h1>Destiny Number 3 Meaning</h1>
      <p>
        Being a number 3, makes you a true artist and entertainer. Expressing
        your truth in creative, joyful and uplifting ways. Destiny 3s achieve
        their aims in life by being:
        <ul>
          <li>Optimistic</li>
          <li>creative</li>
          <li>romantic</li>
          <li>humorous</li>
          <li>entertaining</li>
        </ul>
        If you’re destiny number 3, your optimism makes you a joy to be near.
        You’re so easy to be around. You hide disappointment behind wit, humour,
        and a perky expression. You’ll never let anyone see you in pain. You
        crave the love of family and friends but you refuse to let anyone know.
        Luckily people love you. You’re a performer and full of creativity as a
        3.
